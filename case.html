    <p>You slowly unzip the pencil case, not wanting to get your hopes up. You hear a faint buzz and jump out of your seat as a drone flies out of your pencil case. It delivers a pen, knowing that you needed it. You finish your assignment and get an A+. The teacher doesn't even mark you down for being late. All thanks to the drone.
